                    <p>Online shopping is a form of electronic commerce which allows consumers to directly buy goods or services from a seller over the internet using a web browser. Consumers find a product of interest by visiting the website of the retailer directly or by searching among alternative vendors using a shopping search engine, which displays the same product's availability and pricing at different e-retailers. As of 2016, customers can shop online using a range of different computers and devices, including desktop computers, laptops, tablet computers and smartphones.<p>

                    <h4 style="color:blue">1960</h4>
                    <p>One of the earliest forms of trade conducted online was IBM's online transaction processing(OLTP) developed in 1960s.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h4 style="color:blue">1985</h4>
                    <p>The processing of financial transactions in realtime. The computerized ticket reservation system developed for American Airlines called Semi-Automatic Business Research Environment (SABRE) was one of its applications.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h4 style="color:blue">1990</h4>
                    <p>Here, computer terminals located in different travel agencies were linked to a large IBM mainframe computer, which processed transactions simultaneously and coordinated them so that all travel agents had access to the same information at the same time.</p>

                    <h3>GROWTH</h3><br>
                        <b>Growth in online shoppers</b><br><br>
                            <p>As the revenues from online sales continued to grow significantly researchers identified different types of online shoppers, Rohm & Swaninathan identified four categories and named them "convenience shoppers, variety seekers, balanced buyers, and store oriented shoppers". They focused on shopping motivations and found that the variety of products available and the perceived convenience of the buying onnline experience were significant motivating factors.</p>
